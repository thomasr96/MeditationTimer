# MeditationTimer
The Meditation Timer is an Android app that allows the user to set bells that ring in intervals. Different bells can be set in the beginning and ending of the session as well as a different bell in intervals. Each of the three bell types is optional and can be chosen from a list of thirteen bells and singing bowls that range across multiple pitches. The bell and time settings can also be saved and loaded so that your session can begin in seconds. The app can be installed from the Google Play Store from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meditationtimer.
